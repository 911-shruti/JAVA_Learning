        Error: the problems in the program
                     or
         whenever we see some issue with the program, and it doesn't work as expected.
             3 Types
             1>. Syntax error: while writing a program, something wrong in syntax. or
              when the compiler finds something wrong with the program it throws some error.
             i.e., int a=5;
                  System.out.println(a+b);
                  d=5;
             2>. Logical error/bug: if the program doesn't work as we expected
                  i,e in a chatting app, the message delivered to the wrong address
                   or on clicking some button the website throws us into unknown
                    website or outside the site.
             3>. Runtime error(also called exception): when the program shows or gets error
                                   while running it may be when a user enters some wrong input
             we mostly use exception handling to let our users know the reason behind
             the issue they face at runtime.

             the runtime error is mostly faced at a user end & the Syntax and logical error
             are faced at a programmer end.
